# Shallow-Neural-Network-Architecture
In this notebook, I explore the workings of a shallow neural network architecture particularly a single hidden layer neural network.
The notebook offers a deep mathematical dive into the basics of forward propagation and back propagation thereby demonstrating how a general neural network would work.
Finally the notebook translates this "mathematical intuition" into code from scratch relying only on NumPy functionalities (rather than ML libraries like sklearn and TensorFlow)
to develop the Neural Network model.
